								<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
									<h3>Out-of-order RISC V Processor</h3>
									<p>Implemented an three-way superscalar R10K style out-of-order processor in System Verilog.
										Features include load-store queue with store-to-load forwarding, associative data cache,
										advanced correlating branch predictor, and early branch resolution, acheiving a clock period
										of 12 ns. </p>
								</article>
								<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
									<h3>Threading Library</h3>
									<p>Wrote a library in C++ 17 to administer the creation, lifetime, and execution of concurrent threads in a multi-core system, supporting condition variables, mutexes, semaphores, yields, joins, and interprocess interrupts (IPI).</p>
								</article>
								<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
									<h3>Virtual Memory Manager</h3>
									<p>Implemented a virtual memory pager which managed various application address spaces, and provided support for both file and swap back pages, process forks from non-empty arena, and physical memory / disk management.</p>
								</article>
								<article class="col-6 col-12-xsmall work-item">
									<h3>Search Engine</h3>
									<p>Designed and implemented a scalable search engine, leveraging
										information retrieval techniques such as TF-IDF and PageRank. Developed an inverted index using a MapReduce
										pipeline, an index server with a REST API to provide search results in JSON format, and a user-friendly interface to
										deliver search functionality like leading search engines.</p>
								</article>
